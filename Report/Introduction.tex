\section*{\textsc{\Large Introduction}}

The goal of the project was to simulate a memory system that implements a two level cache structure composed of L1 instruction, L1 data, and a unified L2 cache.  In this system, misses in L1 are handled by L2, and misses in L2 are handled by main memory. The simulation is designed to evaluate the performance and cost of specific hardware configurations given real world traces.
